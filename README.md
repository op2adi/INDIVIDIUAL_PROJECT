# Sentiment Analysis with DistilBERT

This repository contains a Python script for sentiment analysis using the DistilBERT model and PyTorch. The script includes functions for training the model, evaluating its performance, and making predictions.

## Getting Started

To use the provided code, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/op2adi/INDIVIDIUAL_PROJECT.git
```

# Install the required dependencies:
  
# Code Structure
sentiment_analysis.py: The main script containing the implementation of the sentiment analysis model, training, evaluation, and prediction functions.
```bash
pip install torch transformers scikit-learn
```

# Navigate to specified directory

  ```cd INDIVIDIUAL_PROJECT```

# Run the script:
```python sentiment_analysis.py```


## Usage

# Training and Evaluation
The train function in the script trains the sentiment analysis model. Used normal lines for training for faster working, still more data need to be added (mainly training set to check and train for verseatile nature).


# Prediction
The predict function allows you to perform sentiment analysis on a given text. Modify the raw_text variable with the text you want to analyze.
raw_text = "I really enjoyed this movie. It was fantastic!"


# Model and Hyperparameters
The sentiment analysis model is based on the DistilBERT architecture, a lightweight version of BERT. The model is fine-tuned using the AdamW optimizer with a learning rate of 2e-5. You can adjust the hyperparameters in the script as needed.

# Acknowledgments
This code is built using the PyTorch library and Huggingface's Transformers library.
The toy data provided in the script is for demonstration purposes only. Replace it with your own dataset.**


# *IMP TO NOTE
if want to use it please replace test data with yours to get results please mail me your results to improve my code (aditya22040@iiitd.ac.in)
